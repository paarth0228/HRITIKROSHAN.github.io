    <h3>2000–2002: Debut, success and setback</h3>
<p>Roshan was originally scheduled to make his screen debut as a lead actor opposite Preity Zinta in the cancelled film Shekhar Kapur's Tara Rum Pum Pum.[23] Instead, he starred in his father's romantic drama Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000) opposite another debutante, Ameesha Patel. Roshan played dual roles: Rohit, an aspiring singer brutally killed after witnessing a murder, and Raj, an NRI who falls in love with Patel's character.[24] To prepare, he trained with the actor Salman Khan to bulk up physically,[25] worked to improve his diction and took lessons in acting, singing, dancing, fencing and riding.<p>

     <h3>2003–2008: Revival and awards success</h3>
     <p>Roshan's career began to revive with a starring role in Koi... Mil Gaya (2003).[20][50] The film, directed and produced by his father, centers on his character Rohit Mehra, a developmentally disabled young man, who comes in contact with an extraterrestrial being—a role that required him to lose nearly 8 kilograms (18 lb). Roshan recalls the experience of starring in the film fondly: "I could live my childhood [again]. I could eat as many chocolates as I wanted. I became a baby and everybody was so caring towards me.</p.

       <h3>2009–2012: Critical acclaim</h3>
       <p>Following a small role in Zoya Akhtar's Luck by Chance in 2009, Roshan starred in and recorded "Kites in the Sky" for the multi-national romantic thriller Kites (2010).[76] In the film, produced by his father, he played a man running a green card scam in Las Vegas in which he has married 11 different women in exchange for money. Kites opened on a record-breaking 3000 screens, and became the first Bollywood film to break into the North American top 10</p>

       <h3>2013–present: Krrish 3 and beyond</h3>
       <p>Roshan appeared in the third instalment of the Krrish film series—Krrish 3 (2013) which also starred Priyanka Chopra, Vivek Oberoi and Kangana Ranaut. During production, Roshan was injured when he fell down, which resulted in back pain.[100][101] Critics thought that the film was entertaining but lacking in originality, though Roshan's performance garnered praise.[102] The editor Komal Nahta lauded Roshan for playing three different characters in the film, and the actor received his eleventh Filmfare nomination for Best Actor.[103][104] Krrish 3 grossed ₹2.91 billion (US$41 million) worldwide, becoming one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time.</p>
